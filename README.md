# DeepLearning-projects-
Developed a deep learning model to automatically recognize handwritten digits (0â€“9) from image data using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model was built and trained using TensorFlow and Keras, achieving high accuracy in digit classification. 
# Sign Digits Recognition

## Description
This project implements a hand sign digit recognition system using deep learning with TensorFlow and Keras. It classifies images of hand gestures representing digits (0-9) to enable intuitive human-computer interaction through sign language digit recognition.

## Features
- Image preprocessing and augmentation for better model generalization.
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with Keras for high accuracy.
- Training and evaluation on a labeled dataset of hand sign digit images.
- Model saving and loading for inference on new images.
- (Optional) Real-time digit recognition using webcam input.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow and Keras
- OpenCV (for image processing and webcam input)
- NumPy
